**JUST DOWNLOAD NOTEBOOK AND RUN ALL CELLS**

This Notebook contains setup to run Multiclass **MNIST classifier** Neural Network (**1 Hidden Layer**) implemented in **JAVA** without the use of any ML library like deeplearning4j etc. Very Simple architecture, just one hidden layer of 64 neurons. Gives 80% accuracy in 200 epoch as default setting, **above 90% in 1000 epochs** with lr=1 and **above 97% in 3k** with lr=1.
Only dependency is JAMA library, it is **used for only Matrix Multiplication**.

Get the link to dataset (*csv*) , Scripts and Jar file on drive and just run all the cells.
```
NOTE : Run via shell, Script takes three command line arguments

1.  Path to csv
2.  Total epochs
3.  Learning Rate

```

***Model Trains on CPU, make sure your **JVM heap memory** is set to minimum of 6GB***
